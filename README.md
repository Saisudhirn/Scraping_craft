## Introduction

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. Over the course of various projects, I've had the need to collect data from different websites. This repository is a collection of those scraping scripts, serving as both a personal reference and a resource for others.

## Disclaimer

It's crucial to understand that web scraping can be legally and ethically complicated. Before running any script:
- Always review and respect the website's `robots.txt` file.
- Avoid making rapid-fire requests; add delays to prevent IP bans.
- Understand the legal implications and ensure you have permission to scrape and use the data.
- The scripts are provided for educational purposes. Use them responsibly.
